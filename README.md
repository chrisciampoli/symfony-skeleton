# Luxer Symfony Base

Used for testing backend devs - or - as a base development project

## Installation

1. Install Docker
2. Install docker-compose
3. Clone repo
4. Run ./Make (may need to chmod +x this, may need to use sudo based on system permissions)
5. Site will be running at http://localhost
6. Symfony code for additions or edits is located in App/ <--- this is where you make changes!

## BUGS
1. Currently when you run Make for the first time, on initial creation the DB container will create then stop
   you will need to manually up this container again.  This happens only on intial project start.
